Option Chain Lookup (Proof-of-Concept)

## Running the Proof-of-Concept:
1. `git clone` this repo
2. `yarn` to install dependencies
3. `yarn server` to begin running the `express` server (which serves test data as a local API)
4. `yarn start` to start the development environment & hot-reloading
   - _Note:_ This will also launch your browser, and send you to the POC's main page

## Running Unit Tests:
* `yarn test` will run the test-runner in `--watch` mode (tests will rerun if relevant code changes are made)
